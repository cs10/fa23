Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a upcoming sophmore studying EECS and this will be my first time teaching CS-10. My freshman year I came to this school with minimal programming experince. This course was crucial in providing me a solid foundation of programming skills and abilities which even aided me in courses beyond this one. My main goal is to help foster this same foundation in the people that I work with in my journey as an AI.
