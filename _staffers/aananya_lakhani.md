Hi! :) Iâ€™m a rising sophmore studying CS and physics, and this is my second time AI-ing in CS10. I came into CS10 fall of 2022 without a lot of coding experience, however, with the support of the CS10 staff I was able to learn so much in just one semester. CS and coding are such important tools in our world today and I hope to provide support to the students this semester, so that they can also experience the beauty and joy of computing.
