Hey everyone! Iâ€™m a rising senior studying Computer Science + Data Science, and this is my fifth semester working on staff for CS10. I took CS10 during my spring semester of Freshman year and I love the creative and critical thinking aspects that CS provides, so I decided to change my major to CS! This summer, I'll be taking <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS160/"> CS160: User Interface Design and Development</a> and I'm looking into learning fullstack development through personal projects! During my free time, I like to watch anime, try out new restaurants, and host social events for clubs! I'm super excited to work with all of you this semester :)
