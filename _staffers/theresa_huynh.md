Hello!! I'm a rising senior majoring in Cognitive Science and this is my first time being an AI for CS-10. I didn't have much experience with coding prior to taking CS-10 and I think this class was an amazing entryway to programming and understanding CS conceptually. In my free time I like to play games, listen to music, and hang out with friends. I'm really excited to work with and get to know everyone this semester :)
